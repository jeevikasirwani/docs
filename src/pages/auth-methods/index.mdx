# Authentication Methods

You can use third party authentication systems to access Phase. You can delegate the authentication and administration to a external authentication provider like (Google, AWS IAM, GitHub, Kubernetes, GitLab, Microsoft Azure etc.) to best suite your setup. While considering the authentication providers to delegate to, please consider weather the mode of accessing Phase will be programmatic (machine-access) e.g., REST API, SDK, CLI etc. or user access (human-access).


## User authentication

used in web apps, console

sso providers

## Programmatic authentication

When using thid party auth systes to gain programmatic access to Phase, you are delegating the authentication of a particular accessor to a third party and using that as a assertion to gain access to a Phase Service Token which can be used to access secrets. In practice, it works as follows - a service (accessor) trying to access secrets stored in Phase will use a third party autehtnication token such as a JWT service account token in the case of Kubernetes, AWS IAM v4 Signature in the case of AWS and send it to Phase, Phase will intern validate the token or the signature by using third party authentication system APIs and validate the identity of the accessor and return a Phase Service Token in accordance with the RBAC policy. The accessor can then use the Phase Service Token to access secretets in Phase. 

suited for CLIs, SDKs, Kubernetes Operator, REST APIs etc.



### External auth method considerations

- If you want to use an external auth provider to programmatically authenticate with Phase to access sensitive data (e.g., Secrets) via the Phase API, SDKs or the Kubernetes Operator, you will to enable Server-side Encryption (SSE) so that Phase can generate a Service Token.
- When using an external auth method (e.g., Kubernetes), Phase will call the external service at the time of authentication and for subsequent token renewals. If the status of an entity changes in the external system (e.g., an account expires or is disabled), Phase will deny the requests to renew tokens associated with the entity. However, any existing token remain valid for the original grant period unless they are explicitly revoked.
