# Audit Log Management

Phase keeps detailed audit logs of secret access, particularly read events. These logs can accumulate quickly, especially in environments with frequent secret polling. To manage database size and performance, you can periodically clean up old audit logs. In future releases we will provider a simpler way manage this directly from the Phase Console.

## Purging Old Audit Logs

You can use the `purge_app_logs` utility command to safely remove old audit Logs. Execute this command from within the `backend` container:

<Note>
Secret creation logs will not be deleted as they are required for the functioning of other features like secret history and point in time recovery.
</Note>

```fish
python manage.py purge_app_logs -h
usage: manage.py purge_app_logs [-h] [--retain RETAIN] [--app-id APP_ID] [--version] [-v {0,1,2,3}] [--settings SETTINGS] [--pythonpath PYTHONPATH] [--traceback] [--no-color] [--force-color] [--skip-checks] org_name

Purge logs older than a specified number of days for a specific organisation or app.

positional arguments:
  org_name              Name of the organisation

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --retain RETAIN       Number of days of logs to retain (default: 30, 0 to delete all)
  --app-id APP_ID       ID of a specific app to delete logs for (optional)
  --version             Show program's version number and exit.
  -v {0,1,2,3}, --verbosity {0,1,2,3}
                        Verbosity level; 0=minimal output, 1=normal output, 2=verbose output, 3=very verbose output
  --settings SETTINGS   The Python path to a settings module, e.g. "myproject.settings.main". If this isn't provided, the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable will be used.
  --pythonpath PYTHONPATH
                        A directory to add to the Python path, e.g. "/home/djangoprojects/myproject".
  --traceback           Raise on CommandError exceptions.
  --no-color            Don't colorize the command output.
  --force-color         Force colorization of the command output.
  --skip-checks         Skip system checks.
```

```fish
# Basic usage - purges logs older than 30 days
python manage.py purge_app_logs <organisation_name>

# Purge logs older than 60 days
python manage.py purge_app_logs <organisation_name> --retain 60

# Purge logs for a specific app only
python manage.py purge_app_logs <organisation_name> --app-id <app-id>

# Combine retention period and app-specific purging
python manage.py purge_app_logs <organisation_name> --retain 60 --app-id <app-id>
```

This utility is available on the `backend` the the `worker` service containers. You may use the docker command to shell into the container and run the command.

Examples:
```fish
# Via Docker 
docker exec -it <container_id> python manage.py purge_app_logs SpaceX --retain 90

# Via Docker compose
docker compose exec worker python manage.py purge_app_logs SpaceX --retain 90

# Via Kubernetes
kubectl exec -it <pod_name> python manage.py purge_app_logs SpaceX --retain 90
```

### Performance considerations

For Phase instances with 100+ Million of audit-log events or more, we recommend running the `purge_app_logs` command during off-peak hours to avoid performance degradation. In our testing it took about 2.5 minutes to delete 1 Million read events on a AWS RDS `db.t3.micro` instance.
