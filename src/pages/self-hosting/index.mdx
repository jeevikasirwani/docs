# Self Hosting

Explore deployment options for self-hosting Phase. {{ className: 'lead' }}

To meet various compliance requirements or to simply maintain control over your data, you may want to self-host Phase instead of using [Phase Cloud](https://console.phase.dev).


When self hosting Phase services on your own infrastructure, you assume sole responsibility for security, reliability and availability. It is up to you to set up valid **TLS certificates**, **web application firewall**, **database backups** and **replication**, **DDoS protection**, **rate limiting**,**SSOs** etc.
