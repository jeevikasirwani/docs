# Secrets

Secrets are key/value pairs used to store application secrets or environment variables for your applications. Secrets in Phase can additionally have tags and comments associated with them. All changes to secrets are logged and viewable from the secret history or App logs screens.

## Create a Secret

To create a Secret in a specific Environment, click the "New Secret" button. This will create a new empty secret, with a blank key and value. Enter the desired key and value and click "Deploy" to save your changes.

<Note>
Secrets cannot be empty, or have the same 'key' as another secret in this Environment at the same path.
</Note>

## Import Secrets

You can import secrets into your Apps and Environments by dragging-and-dropping `.env` files or selecting them from your filesystem. 

By default, this will parse all key-value pairs in your .env files, as well as any comments that are either in-line or precede a key-value pair. You can also open the "Import secrets" menu for more detailed import options as well as a textarea to simply paste the contents of your .env file.

Here's a quick demo of how to import secrets into a single environment:

You can also import `.env` files into multiple Environments simultaneously from the Secrets tab. You'll be able to decide which specific environments to import into, and whether or not to include values and comments in each respective Environment. This is great for quickly initializing your App with dev secrets from your local `.env` file, while populating other Environments with just the corresponding keys.

## Secret Referencing

You can use the value of other secrets inside a given secret across environments and folders. This may be useful for things like database connection strings.

Example:

```fish
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME}
DB_USER=j_mclaren
DB_PASSWORD=2ff9853e23b68587480da26a478b782aa8aeafe46ec716d0667ad7078870c345
DB_HOST=mc-laren-prod-db.c9ufzjtplsaq.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=XP1_LM

# will resolve to:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://j_mclaren:6c37810ec6e74ec3228416d2844564fceb99ebd94b29f4334c244db011630b0e@mc-laren-prod-db.c9ufzjtplsaq.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/XP1_LM
```

### Secret referencing syntax:

| Value reference syntax | Environment | Path | Secret Key Being Referenced | Description |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| `${KEY}` | same environment | `/` | KEY | Local reference in the same environment and path root (/). |
| `${staging.DEBUG}` | `staging` | `/` (root of staging environment) | DEBUG | Cross-environment reference to a secret at the root (/). |
| `${production./frontend/SECRET_KEY}` | `production` | `/frontend/` | SECRET_KEY | Cross-environment reference to a secret in a specific path. |
| `${/backend/payments/STRIPE_KEY}` | same environment | `/backend/payments/` | STRIPE_KEY | Local reference with a specified path within the same environment. |
| `${backend_api::production./frontend/SECRET_KEY}` | `production` (in `backend_api` app) | `/frontend/` | SECRET_KEY | Cross-application reference to a secret in a specific path within another application. |

#### Please note the following when using secret referencing:

- **Authentication requirements**: Your authentication token must have access to all referenced secrets across apps, environments, and paths. If access is insufficient, the reference won't be resolved and will be returned with the original syntax. For example, if you have access to the `production` environment in `backend_api` but not in `frontend`, the value `${backend_api::production./frontend/SECRET_KEY}` will remain unresolved.

- **Third-party sync integration behavior**: When syncing to third-party services, Phase requires all secret references to be resolvable. The sync will fail if any referenced secret doesn't exist in its specified location (locally, in a path, or in an app). This design ensures third-party platforms never receive broken references, as many support their own native referencing syntax.

- **Name collision handling**: If two or more applications in your organization share the same name (case insensitive), any secret reference to these applications will be deemed ambiguous and will be returned unresolved when accessed via the REST API. Additionally, any sync operation involving these ambiguous references will fail with an error message.

- **Server-side Encryption (SSE)**: For references to resolve over the Public API or native integrations, all referenced apps must have SSE enabled. If a secret is being referenced in an app without SSE, the reference will not resolve and will be returned as-is over the API, and sync jobs will fail.  Note: SSE is not required for references to resolve when using E2E enabled clients such as the CLI or SDKs.

## Override a Secret (Personal Secrets)

You can override the value of a Secret with a Personal Secret. This can be useful for using API keys, authentication credentials, or other environment variables that are unique to your development setup without having to modify the environment for other users.
When applied, the overridden value of the Secret will only be visible to you.
When developing locally with the Phase CLI, the override value will be used by default.

To create a Personal Secret, click on the "Override" button for a secret.

![secret override button](/assets/images/console/secrets/personal-secret-button.png)

Then simply enter the value you wish to override this secret with. You can also control whether a Personal Secret override is active or not with the "Activate Secret Override" switch.

![create personal secret](/assets/images/console/secrets/personal-secret-create.png)

## Tag a Secret

To apply a tag to a Secret, hover on the Secret row and click on "Tags" in the secret key input box to open the Tags dialog.
You can select one or more tags to apply to this Secret, or create new Tags if required.

![tag a secret](/assets/images/console/secrets/secret-tags-edit.png)

All tags applied to a secret will be displayed inline with the secret name.

![view secret tags](/assets/images/console/secrets/secret-tags-display.png)

**Note: Secret tags are not saved until you "Deploy" changes to the Environment**

## Add comments to a Secret

To add comments to a Secret, hover in the Secret row and click on the "Comment" button in the value input box to open the comment dialog. Type your comment and close the dialog.

![edit secret comment](/assets/images/console/secrets/secret-comment-edit.png)

Secrets with comments will be identifiable by a green comment icon.

![view secret comment](/assets/images/console/secrets/secret-comment-display.png)

**Note: Secret comments are not saved until you "Deploy" changes to the Environment**

## View Secret history

You can view the entire history of a Secret by hovering on the Secret row and clicking the "History" button.
This dialog shows a timeline of changes to all properties of this secret, with timestamps and user information for each change.

You can also restore the "Value" of a secret from history by clicking the "Restore" button. This will update the value of the Secret, and will be saved when you next Deploy your changes.

## Delete a Secret

To delete a secret, hover on the Secret row and click the "Delete" button.
