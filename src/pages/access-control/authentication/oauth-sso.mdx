## GitHub

Follow these steps to set up GitHub SSO for your Phase application:

If you are using GitHub Enterprise Server (self-hosted) instance, you may follow the steps below to set up GitHub SSO for your Phase application as the instructions are nearly identical. The only exception being the Authorization callback URL.

<Note>
   GitHub Enterprise Server (self-hosted) instance for OAuth SSO is only available for organizations with an `Enterprise` tier subscription. See [Pricing](https://phase.dev/pricing).
</Note>

1. Log in to your GitHub account and go to [OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/developers) in Developer Settings.

2. Click "New OAuth App".

   ![Create a new GitHub OAuth app](/assets/images/auth/sso/github/1-create-new-oauth-app.png)

3. Fill in the application details:

   <Properties>
     <Property name="Application name" type="string">
       Phase Console
     </Property>
     <Property name="Homepage URL" type="string">
       `https://[**YOUR_DOMAIN**]`
     </Property>
     <Property name="Authorization callback URL" type="string">
       For GitHub.com: `https://[**YOUR_DOMAIN**]/api/auth/callback/github`<br/>
       For GitHub Enterprise Server: `https://[**YOUR_DOMAIN**]/api/auth/callback/github-enterprise`
     </Property>
   </Properties>

   ![Configure and register a new application](/assets/images/auth/sso/github/2-configure-register-application.png)

7. Supply these credentials to your Phase Console deployment as [environment variables](/self-hosting/configuration/envars#git-hub-o-auth-2-0). If you are using GitHub Enterprise (self-hosted), supply the following configurations as [environment variables](/self-hosting/configuration/envars#git-hub-enterprise-o-auth-2-0).

You can find detailed official instructions for setting up SSO with a GitHub OAuth Application [here](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app). 

## GitLab

Follow these steps to set up GitLab SSO for your Phase application:

1. Log in to your GitLab account and go to User Preferences > Applications.

   ![Navigate to User Preferences](/assets/images/auth/sso/gitlab/1-personal-preferences.png)

   ![Navigate to User Applications](/assets/images/auth/sso/gitlab/2-applications.png)

2. Click on "Add new application".  

   ![Add new application](/assets/images/auth/sso/gitlab/3-add-new-application.png)

3. Fill in the application details:

   <Properties>
     <Property name="Name" type="string">
       Phase Console SSO
     </Property>
     <Property name="Redirect URI" type="string">
       `https://[**YOUR_DOMAIN**]/api/auth/callback/gitlab`
     </Property>
     <Property name="Confidential" type="boolean">
       âœ“ (Check this box)
     </Property>
     <Property name="Scopes" type="string">
       `read_user` (The only scope required)
     </Property>
   </Properties>

   ![Configure new application](/assets/images/auth/sso/gitlab/4-application-config-permission.png)

Make sure the application has the `read_user` scope. This grants read-only access to the user's profile through the /user API endpoint, which includes username, public email, and full name.

4. Click "Save application".

    ![Configure new application](/assets/images/auth/sso/gitlab/5-save-application.png)

5. On the next screen, copy the Application ID and Secret.

   ![Copy Application ID and Secret](/assets/images/auth/sso/gitlab/6-copy-application-id-application-secret.png)

6. Supply these credentials to your Phase Console deployment as [environment variables](/self-hosting/configuration/envars#git-lab-sso).

<Note>
  You can use user-owned or group-owned applications to login to Phase. If you are running a self-hosted instance, you can also use an instance-wide application.
