# OpenID Connect (OIDC) Single sign-on (SSO)

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0 that allows applications to verify user identities. It enables secure authentication through trusted identity providers while eliminating the need for separate credentials. Phase supports OIDC-based SSO integration with major providers like Google, allowing seamless and secure access to your applications. Currently, OIDC authentication can be only set-up for a Self-hosted Phase deployment.

<Note>
 The OIDC SSO as an authentication method is only available for organizations with a `Enterprise` tier subscription. See [Pricing](https://phase.dev/pricing).

## Google

Google's OAuth 2.0 APIs are compatible with OpenID Connect (OIDC) and can be used to set up SSO. In fact, you can use your existing Google OAuth 2.0 credentials for OIDC authentication as long as you set the 'Authorized redirect URIs' correctly.

Follow these steps to set up Google SSO for your Phase application:

1. Go to your [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and click the "Select a project" dropdown.

2. Click "New project". If you already have a project you want to use, select it from the list and skip to step 5.

3. Enter a valid Project Name and click "Create".

6. Click on "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" and select "OAuth client ID". If this is your first time creating an OAuth credential, you'll need to set up a consent screen. If you've already set up a consent screen, skip to Step 13.

14. In the Application type dropdown, select "Web application". Enter a recognizable name in the Name field, add the Authorized redirect URI (e.g., https://[**YOUR_DOMAIN**].com/api/auth/callback/google), and click "CREATE".

    ![Create OAuth client ID config](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/14-create-oauth-client-id-config.png)

15. You will be presented with the OAuth Client ID and Client secret. Copy these by clicking the clipboard icon next to each.

16. Supply these credentials to your Phase Console deployment as [environment variables](/self-hosting/configuration/envars#google-sso).
