# OpenID Connect (OIDC) Single Sign-On (SSO)

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0 that allows applications to verify user identities. It enables secure authentication through trusted identity providers while eliminating the need for separate credentials. Phase supports OIDC-based SSO integration with major providers like Google, allowing seamless and secure access to your applications. Currently, OIDC authentication can be set up only for a Self-hosted Phase deployment.

<Note>
 OIDC SSO as an authentication method is only available for organizations with an `Enterprise` tier subscription. See [Pricing](https://phase.dev/pricing).
</Note>

## Google

Google's OAuth 2.0 APIs are compatible with OpenID Connect (OIDC) and can be used to set up SSO. In fact, you can use your existing Google OAuth 2.0 credentials for OIDC authentication as long as you set the 'Authorized redirect URIs' correctly.

Follow these steps to set up Google SSO for your Phase application:

1. Go to your [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and click the "Select a project" dropdown.

   ![Select a project](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/1-select-a-project.png)

2. Click "New project". If you already have a project you want to use, select it from the list and skip to step 5.

   ![New project select](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/2-new-project-select.png)

3. Enter a valid Project Name and click "Create".

4. Go to your newly created project by clicking "SELECT PROJECT" from the notifications.

   ![Go to new project](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/4-go-to-new-project.png)

5. In your console's search box, type 'Credentials' and click on the result that says "Credentials - APIs & Services".

   ![Search credentials](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/5-search-credentials.png)

6. Click on "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" and select "OAuth client ID". If this is your first time creating an OAuth credential, you'll need to set up a consent screen. If you've already set up a consent screen, skip to Step 13.

   ![Create OAuth client ID](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/6-create-oauth-client-id.png)

7. When prompted to configure an OAuth consent screen, click the "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN" button.

8. Choose "External" as the User Type for the OAuth consent screen.

   ![Create external consent screen](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/8-create-external-consent-screen.png)

9. Enter details for mandatory fields such as App name, User support email, and Developer contact information. Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE".

11. Continue through the Test user setup screen by clicking "SAVE AND CONTINUE".

    ![Consent screen test users save and continue](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/12-consent-screen-test-users-save-continue.png)

12. Review the details of your Consent screen app registration and click "BACK TO DASHBOARD".

    ![Consent screen back to dashboard](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/13-consent-screen-back-to-dashboard.png)

13. In the APIs & Services dashboard, click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" and select "OAuth client ID" from the dropdown.

    ![Select a project](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/1-select-a-project.png)

14. In the Application type dropdown, select "Web application". Enter a recognizable name in the Name field, add the Authorized redirect URI (e.g., https://[**YOUR_DOMAIN**].com/api/auth/sso/oidc/callback/google), and click "CREATE".

   You can copy the following path, please make sure to pre-fix it with scheme + your domain.

   ```
   /api/auth/sso/oidc/callback/google
   ```

    ![Create OAuth client ID config](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/14-create-oauth-client-id-config.png)

15. You will be presented with the OAuth Client ID and Client secret. Copy these by clicking the clipboard icon next to each.

16. Supply these credentials to your Phase Console deployment as [environment variables](/self-hosting/configuration/envars#google-oidc).
