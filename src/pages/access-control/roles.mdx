# Roles

Roles in Phase define the level of access and permissions granted to users within an organization. They determine what actions a user can perform and what resources they can access. Phase offers both managed roles with predefined permissions and the ability to create custom roles for more specific access control needs.

## Applying Roles to Users

To assign a role to a user or change a user's role:

1. Navigate to the Access Control tab and click on the Members section.
2. Find the user whose role you want to update.
3. Click on the user's current role next to their name to open the role selection dropdown.
4. Choose the desired role from the list of available roles.
5. Confirm the change.

## Managed Roles

Phase provides managed roles out of the box to every organization.

## Custom Roles

<Note>
 The ability to create and manage custom roles is available for organizations with a `Phase Pro` or `Enterprise` tier subscription.
</Note>

In addition to the managed roles, Phase allows you to create custom roles tailored to your organization's specific security needs.

### Creating Custom Roles

1. Navigate to the Access Control tab and click on the Roles section.
2. Click on "Create Role".
3. Provide a name and description for the role. (Role name is mandatory)
4. Expand the Organisation and the App permissions sections by clicking on each of them and select the desired policy permissions by clicking the dropdown for each resource in the Access column and selecting one of the following:
    - 🚫 No access
    - 👁️ Read access
    - ❄️ Full access
    - 📝 Custom access

Alternatively, you may provision a custom Access Policy by toggling switches in each of the CRUD operations for a given resource.  

5. Save the new role.

### Editing Custom Roles

1. Navigate to the Access Control tab and click on the Roles section.
2. Find the custom role you want to edit, hover over it and click ⚙️ Manage.
