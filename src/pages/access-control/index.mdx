# Authentication & Access Control

Phase supports third-party authentication systems for access control. You can delegate authentication and administration to external providers such as Google, AWS IAM, GitHub, Kubernetes, GitLab, or Microsoft Azure to best suit your setup. When choosing an authentication provider, consider whether the access to Phase will be programmatic (machine-access) via REST API, SDK, CLI, etc., or user access (human-access). Phase employs a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage permissions for both human users and programmatic access via Service Accounts.

## Overview

Phase's access control system is based on roles that define policies governing the behavior and access of clients, whether they are human Users or Service Accounts. The system allows for fine-grained control over resources at both the organization and application levels.

## User Authentication

User authentication in Phase is designed for seamless and secure access for human users. Phase supports various Single Sign-On (SSO) providers, allowing organizations to leverage their existing identity management systems. Currently, Phase offers OAuth-based authentication with Google, GitHub, GitLab.com, and GitLab self-managed instances. Users can easily log into Phase using their credentials from supported SSO providers.

We plan to extend support to SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) and OIDC (OpenID Connect), which will allow Phase to integrate with a wider range of identity providers, including enterprise-grade identity management systems. Furthermore, integration with SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) will enable automatic synchronization of user directories with Phase, allowing for automatic provisioning and deprovisioning of user accounts, real-time updates of user attributes and group memberships, all based on changes in the organization's primary identity system.

## Programmatic Authentication

When using third-party authentication systems for programmatic access to Phase, you delegate the authentication of a particular accessor to a third party. This delegation is used as an assertion to obtain a Phase Service Token with the correct set of permissions, which can then be used to access secrets. The process works as follows:

1. A service (accessor) attempting to access secrets stored in Phase uses a third-party authentication token (e.g., a JWT service account token for Kubernetes or an AWS IAM v4 Signature for AWS).
2. The accessor sends this token to Phase.
3. Phase internally validates the token or signature using the third-party authentication system's APIs.
4. Phase validates the identity of the accessor and returns a Phase Service Token in accordance with the RBAC policy.
5. The accessor can then use the Phase Service Token to access secrets in Phase until expiry.
6. Upon expiry, the process can and will be repeated to gain access to a fresh Phase Service Token.


### Access Control - Key Concepts

1. **Roles**: Phase offers default managed roles (e.g., `Owner`, `Admin`, `Developer`) with predefined permissions. Users can also create custom roles for more specific access control.

2. **Access**: This defines the level of access (No access, Read access, Full access, Custom access) for various resources.

3. **Actions**: These define the actions that can be performed (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on various resources.

4. **Resources**: The entities that can be accessed or modified, categorized into organization-level and app-level resources.

### Permissions to Perform Actions (CRUD)

Phase's RBAC system allows you to define permissions for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on various resources. These permissions are assigned to roles, which are then assigned to users or service accounts.

### Resource Categories

#### Organization-level permissions:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Organisation** | Manage overall access to the organization |
| **Billing** | Control access to billing & payment information in settings |
| **Apps** | Manage access to applications within the organization |
| **Members** | Control user membership and access within the organization |
| **Service Accounts** | Manage service account permissions |
| **Roles** | Define and assign roles within the organization |
| **Integration Credentials** | Manage credentials for third-party integrations |

#### App-level permissions:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Environments** | Control access to different secret environments within the app |
| **Secrets** | Manage access to app secrets |
| **Lockbox** | Control access to Lockbox secret sharing |
| **Logs** | Manage access to app and secret audit logs |
| **Tokens** | Control creation and management of access tokens |
| **Members** | Manage user access within the app |
| **Integrations** | Control setup and management of app integrations |
| **Encryption Mode** | Manage encryption settings for the app |

## Global Access

The Phase End-to-End encryption implementation works in conjunction with the access control system to ensure secure and manageable resource access. When a new resource such as an App or an Environment inside an App is created, encryption keys are automatically and securely shared (using Sealed-box encryption) with users holding `Owner` or `Admin` roles. This mechanism prevents the creation of "island resources" - isolated resources within a managed organization that would be invisible or unmanageable by administrators due to lack of access to cryptographic keys.

Global access is a special type of permission that grants users with a "global access" role implicit access to all Apps and Environments across the organization. Currently, Global access is reserved exclusively for the Phase managed `Owner` and `Admin` roles.

### External Auth Method Considerations

- To use an external auth provider for programmatic authentication with Phase to access sensitive data (e.g., Secrets) via the Phase API, SDKs, or the Kubernetes Operator, you will need to enable Server-side Encryption (SSE) so that Phase can generate a Service Token on the server side with access to a given application(s) or environment(s).
- When using an external auth method (e.g., Kubernetes), Phase will call the external service at the time of authentication and for subsequent token renewals. If the status of an entity changes in the external system (e.g., an account expires or is disabled), Phase will deny requests to renew tokens associated with that entity. However, any existing tokens remain valid for their original grant period unless explicitly revoked.
