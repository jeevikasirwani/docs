# Access Control

Phase employs a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage permissions for both human users and programmatic access via Service Accounts.

## Overview

Phase's access control system is based on roles that define policies governing the behavior and access of clients, whether they are human Users or Service Accounts. The system allows for fine-grained control over resources at both the organization and application levels.

### Key Concepts

1. **Roles**: Phase offers default managed roles (e.g., `Owner`, `Admin`, `Developer`) with predefined permissions. Users can also create custom roles for more specific access control.

2. **Access**: This defines the level of access (No access, Read access, Full access, Custom access) for various resources.

3. **Actions**: These define the actions that can be performed (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on various resources.

4. **Resources**: The entities that can be accessed or modified, categorized into organization-level and app-level resources.

### Permissions to Perform Actions (CRUD)

Phase's RBAC system allows you to define permissions for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on various resources. These permissions are assigned to roles, which are then assigned to users or service accounts.

### Resource Categories

#### Organization-level permissions:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Organisation** | Manage overall access to the organization |
| **Billing** | Control access to billing & payment information in settings |
| **Apps** | Manage access to applications within the organization |
| **Members** | Control user membership and access within the organization |
| **Service Accounts** | Manage service account permissions |
| **Roles** | Define and assign roles within the organization |
| **Integration Credentials** | Manage credentials for third-party integrations |

#### App-level permissions:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Environments** | Control access to different secret environments within the app |
| **Secrets** | Manage access to app secrets |
| **Lockbox** | Control access to Lockbox secret sharing |
| **Logs** | Manage access to app and secret audit logs |
| **Tokens** | Control creation and management of access tokens |
| **Members** | Manage user access within the app |
| **Integrations** | Control setup and management of app integrations |
| **Encryption Mode** | Manage encryption settings for the app |

## Global Access

The Phase End-to-End encryption implementation works in conjunction with the access control system to ensure secure and manageable resource access. When a new resource such as an App or an Environment inside an App is created, encryption keys are automatically and securely shared (using Sealed-box encryption) with users holding `Owner` or `Admin` roles. This mechanism prevents the creation of "island resources" - isolated resources within a managed organization that would be invisible or unmanageable by administrators due to lack of access to cryptographic keys.

Global access is a special type of permission that grants users with a "global access" role implicit access to all Apps and Environments across the organization. Currently, Global access is reserved exclusively for the Phase managed `Owner` and `Admin` roles.
