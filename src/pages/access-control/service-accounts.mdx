# Service Accounts

Service Accounts provide a secure and controlled way for programmatic access of Phase APIs. It can be thought of as a non-human user that can use various authentication mechanisms to access to various resources such as secrets within applications and environments it has been provisioned access to. Service Accounts follow an Access Policy that can be defined by [Managed Roles](/access-control/roles#managed-roles) or [Custom Roles](/access-control/roles#creating-custom-roles) to best suite your access and security requirements.

## Create a new Service Account

3. Give your new service account an Account name and choose a Role and Click "Create Service Account".

By default, when you create a new Service Account it uses the [Service](/access-control/roles#service) role that's managed by Phase which only has access to secrets at the Application level.

[Service](/access-control/roles#service) role secret access policy:

| Resource | Access | Read | Create | Update | Delete |
|----------|--------|------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Secrets** | Full access | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

You may choose to select a different Managed role or a Custom role by clicking the one from the dropdown.
