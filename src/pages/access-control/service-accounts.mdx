# Service Accounts

Service Accounts provide a secure and controlled way for programmatic access of Phase APIs. It can be thought of as a non-human user that can use various authentication mechanisms to access to various resources such as secrets within applications and environments it has been provisioned access to. Service Accounts follow an Access Policy that can be defined by [Managed Roles](/access-control/roles#managed-roles) or [Custom Roles](/access-control/roles#creating-custom-roles) to best suite your access and security requirements.
